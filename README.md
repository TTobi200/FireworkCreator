FireworkCreator (Closed June 2014)
===============
This tool should later be used to create your own "firework plan".
It is an graphical editor for creting simple plans and
saves all necessary data used in each article.
It consists of three panels:
  
  - The Tool-Panel on the left, 
    with all all articles than can be added
    
  - The View-Pane in the center
    where the different firework article get drawn
  
  - The Value-Pane in the south,
    which displays some values from the project and
    the choosen.
